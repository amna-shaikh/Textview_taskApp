To access the flavor-specific configurations in your Dart code,
you can use the const String.fromEnvironment constructor to retrieve the values you defined in the build.yaml file.

For example:
//This is a command how we use different flavors in our app
const String apiEndpoint = const String.fromEnvironment('API_ENDPOINT');
const String appName = const String.fromEnvironment('APP_NAME');


This ia command to build the app with your desired flavor. It will generate for you an APK.
flutter build flavorname
